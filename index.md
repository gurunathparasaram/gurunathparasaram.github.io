I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of Utah. Before starting my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science, I was a Machine Learning engineer focused on building NLP applications at Zoho. I was part of a small team that built a Grammatical Error Correction(GEC) System for text applications, which helped me get involved in various aspects of the Deep Learning pipeline, such as data collection, processing and augmentation, model training and deployment, and using user feedback to improve the model iteratively.

During four wonderful years in Pittsburgh, I collaborated with [Pradeep Ravikumar](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pradeepr/) on explainable AI and [Zico Kolter](http://zicokolter.com/) on automated pothole detection.[Fei Fang](https://feifang.info/) and [Manuela Veloso](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/) on robot affect expression in competitive settings, and [Radu Marculescu](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~radum/) on network science for deep learning.  -->
