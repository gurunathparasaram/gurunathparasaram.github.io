I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer with a strong background in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). My experience includes developing and scaling NLP services, improving model interpretability, and leading product roadmaps. I have consistently improved computational efficiency, performance, and security in my projects. I'm graduating with a Master's degree in Computing at the University of Utah. 

Before my Master's, I was a Machine Learning engineer focused on building NLP applications at Zoho. I was part of a small team that built a Grammatical Error Correction(GEC) System for text applications, which helped me get involved in various aspects of the Deep Learning pipeline, such as data collection, processing and augmentation, model training and deployment, and using user feedback to improve the model iteratively. At Zoho Corporation, I led the development of product roadmaps for various NLP services, aligning technical goals with stakeholder needs. I collaborated with clients to integrate AI and ML features, keeping products competitive. I designed and deployed numerous Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, scaling their usage from 10k to over 120 million requests per day. I also improved API workflows, reducing latency and increasing throughput on GPU, resulting in significant cost savings. I optimized inference using ONNX-Runtime, doubling throughput and achieving a 1.5x speed-up on Transformer models. Additionally, I ensured AI services passed security and privacy audits.
